# Prompter Roadmap

This document outlines Prompter MCP-server's roadmap. The roadmap has three categories. The next up section highlights features which are the most likely to be done next or are already in being implemented. The completed are features which are already in the main branch of the project and released. The potentials are features that might be implemented. This is more a list of ideas that a list of promises. Their order do not indicate priority or the order which they would be implemented.
